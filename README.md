Fix this wheel! #GGJ2020

This game made in GodotEngine should support the homonym board-game created during the Global Game Jam 2020 in Trento.
<br><br>

WARNING!<br>
This game is broken, we had some troubles during the weekend turning our team from 5 to 3 people and creating the need to change
 our idea for timing reasons.<br>
Anyway we could not manage to complete this app.
<br><br><br>

The app should guide you during all the game, leaving all kind of trash talking and bluffing as the fun part of F2F experience.
By the way, in reality the app struggles even managing rounds, I will update it during the next months in my free time so 
that the game can be properly enjoyed.
